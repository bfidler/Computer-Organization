CPSC 2311 Lab 1
Brayden Fidler CPSC 2310 Section 4

1. Run "./acc_x86". Explain what the simulator is doing in the fetch, decode, execute
    cycle. (10 points)

	In fetch it gets the instruction, in decode it interprets the instruction, and in execute it does what the instruction is saying.

2. You should be using one of the branching instructions in your my_loop.m source code (ex: ble0, bgt0, etc.). At which position in memory (i.e. program counter value) is your branch instruction? (10 points)

	Position 17

3. Explain the difference between MDR and MAR. (10 points)
	
	MDR is the register for memory data, mar is the register for memory addresses

4. Run the three versions of the program using acc and record the statistics. (10 points)
	
	1 - 76 executes, 151 fetches, 43 reads, 22 writes
	2 - 98 executes, 195 fetches, 54 reads, 22 writes
	3 - 109 executes, 217 fetches, 65 reads, 22 writes

5. Explain the differences in statistics. (15 points)

	Each program is slower for the machine to process because it has more executes, fetches, and reads

6. Which version do you think is better and why? (15 points)

	Version 1 because it is fetching and reading the least often

7. Fill in the blanks in worksheet_b.txt. (30 points)
